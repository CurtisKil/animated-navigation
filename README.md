## Project Title

Animated Navigation

## Purpose

As a new developer, I want to do a daily coding project tutorial to learn new features and deepen my understanding of Web Development.

## Description

This is a navigation that expands and collapses on the click of an icon. And as it expands and collapses the nav links and icon rotate.
